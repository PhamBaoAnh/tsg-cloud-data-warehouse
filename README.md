# 🌩️ TSG Cloud Data Warehouse

This project implements a **cloud-based data warehouse architecture** for **TSG Company**, leveraging the AWS ecosystem to support scalable data storage, ETL processing, and advanced business intelligence.

---

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

The data warehouse is built on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, using the following core components:

- **Amazon S3** – Cloud data lake for raw and processed data  
- **AWS Glue** – Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service  
- **Amazon Redshift** – Scalable and fast data warehouse for analytical querying

## 📊 Data Analytics & Techniques

The project integrates multiple data analytics techniques and machine learning models:

- 🔗 **Association Rule Mining**  
  - Apriori Algorithm  
  - FP-Growth Algorithm  

- 👥 **Customer Segmentation**  
  - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis  
  - K-Means Clustering  

- 📈 **Time Series Forecasting**  
  - Prophet Model (by Meta)

- 📊 **Data Visualization**  
  - Interactive reports and dashboards built with **Power BI**
